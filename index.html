    <h3>TV News Production</h3>
    <p>This is a 14:30 minute show I produced</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/89vZyQuD_NE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   
    <h3>Obama Goes to School</h3>
    <p>(This is a full package script that I wrote out for a producing assignment.)</P>
    <p> Anchor Lead: President Obama goes back to school. On Monday Obama gave a speech in Washington DC to a high school. Joseph Dickson has the story. 
      <p>
</p>Obama stepped into into Benjamin Banneker Academic High School with a topic on his mind, education and how it has changed. Obama was excited to visit because last month he was planned to give a speech at Annandale High in Fairfax County, Virginia but was postponed due to travel. Obama had a lot of advice for the kids of Benjamin Banneker Academic.<p>
</p>
      “When we understand that no matter what you look like, where you come from, what faith you are, whether you’re a boy or a girl, that you should have great opportunities to succeed and that requires you to put effort into it,” But Obama didn’t stop
      there he wanted the kids to know what they were up against in the world. “We live in a global economy and when you graduate you’re no longer going to be competing just with somebody here in DC for a great job, You’re competing with somebody on the
      other side of the world in China or in India, because jobs can go wherever they want because of the internet, because of technology. And the best jobs are going to go to the people that are the best educated whether in India or China or anywhere
      in the world.” <p>
</p>Obama also tried hard to get in touch with his audience in whatever way he could. At one point acted like he was talking on the phone with someone. He even imitated a student taking a selfie to get more connected with the students
      of Benjamin Banneker Academic High School. This is Joseph Dickson with Daily Iowan TV.
<h3>KRUI News</h3>
    <p>This is a KRUI Radio story I did live on air</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uahi-zIg2UE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <h3>News Fight</h3>

      <p>(This was a radio story I did on KRUI for a news.) </p>
      <p>A unusual fight took twitter by storm. The LA Times and The Chicago Tribune jabbed each other over twitter. Judy Phillips has the story The fight started after The Chicago Tribune to a jab at Los Angeles. “Known widely today as ‘The Birthplace of Cocaine,’ Los Angeles is a stunningly unfortunate city on the Pacific Ocean, located in a semi-arid region known as California’s Crotch.” 
<p>
</p> After a comment like that The LA Times had enough and started to fight back stating in one of their articles addressing this issue that, “My guess is that on the day the L.A. put-down was written, there were fewer than a half-dozen public officials indicted and no blizzards in Chicago, so it was a slow news day.” As it turns out both of these organizations are owned by the same owners but despite that still go into a bit of a tussle.
